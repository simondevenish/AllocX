/**
 * AllocXMemoryPool:
 *
 * A memory pool that manages a fixed number of memory blocks. The memory pool enables
 * allocation and deallocation of blocks without the performance hit of repeatedly
 * requesting memory from the system.
 *
 * Key Fields:
 * - `memory_start`: A pointer to the start of the contiguous memory region managed by the pool.
 * - `block_size`: The size of each memory block in bytes.
 * - `total_blocks`: The total number of blocks in the pool.
 * - `free_list`: A bitmap that tracks the allocation status of each block in the pool.
 *   - Each bit in the `free_list` represents the status of a single block.
 *     - `0`: The block is free (available for allocation).
 *     - `1`: The block is allocated (in use).
 *   - For example - if the `free_list` is:
 *       byte:    0b00001101
 *       blocks:  [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
 *       status:   A  F  A  F  F  F  A  A
 *     In this case:
 *       - Blocks 1, 3, 7, and 8 are allocated (bit = 1).
 *       - Blocks 2, 4, 5, and 6 are free (bit = 0).
 *   - The number of bytes required for the `free_list` is calculated as:
 *     `ceil(total_blocks / 8)` to account for one bit per block.
 * - `free_count`: An atomic counter representing the number of free blocks in the pool.
 * - `allocated_count`: An atomic counter representing the number of allocated blocks.
 *
 * Operations:
 * - ALLOCATION:
 *   - A block is allocated by finding the first `0` bit in the `free_list` and
 *     marking it as `1` (allocated) using a bitwise OR operation.
 *   - The `free_count` is decremented, and the `allocated_count` is incremented atomically.
 * - DEALLOCATION:
 *   - A block is freed by marking its corresponding bit in the `free_list` as `0`
 *   - The `free_count` is incremented, and the `allocated_count` is decremented atomically.
